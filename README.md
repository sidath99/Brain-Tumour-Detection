This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify brain MRI scans into four categories: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary Tumor, and No Tumor. The model was trained on the Kaggle Brain Tumor MRI Dataset with over 7,000 images.

The goal of this project is to help support radiologists by providing accurate, automated, and explainable predictions. With techniques like data augmentation, early stopping, cross-validation, and LIME explainability, the model achieved 98% accuracy.
